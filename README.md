# XML to CSV converter for StackOverflow post data

This script parses the Internet Archve [StackOverflow post data](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) from XML into CSV. 

NB: Yes, I know that SO data is available as a public dataset in Google BigQuery. I am doing this mostly as an exercise in Rust/scripting.
